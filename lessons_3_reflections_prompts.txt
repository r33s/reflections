When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When collaborating with others, or when working from several locations or machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may make a change you do not want to share just yet and someone else who is collaborating with you may start work on it anyways.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    fork when you want to copy a repository on github. clone when you want to copy a repo from github to your machine. branch when you want to try something different in your repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    allows you to work offline knowing what has been updated/changed remotely.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    mostly through email. also could text/call. send code by mail. github centralizes everything and everyone involved can follow along with ease and participate when their time is available.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
